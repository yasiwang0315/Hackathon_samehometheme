# Pick Your Marvel Boyfriend/Girlfriend!

This project is inspired by Same Home Different Hacks (June 12th-14th 2020) by MLH Summer League. We have two team members: Haoxue Li and Yasi Wang.

We built our web application based on the theme: "Silly Hack". We have two goals:
1. List marvel characters on the front page.
2. Have a quiz option for users to explore their ideal marvel character partner.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). And we use external API  SuperHero (https://superheroapi.com/index.html).

## `npm install`

install all libraries for building the application.

## `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## `node src/server.js`

Runs the server in the development mode. <br />
In this way we can fetch result from database.
